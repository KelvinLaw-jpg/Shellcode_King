## ðŸš€ Suggested Learning Path
1. Complete **HTB Academy** for practical penetration testing and shell basics.  
2. Learn **assembly + CPU/memory fundamentals** using x86_32 Assembly labs.  
3. Move to **Red Teaming / Exploit Development courses** to practice shellcode crafting.  
4. Study **advanced / cross-platform courses** for real-world payloads.  
5. Experiment with **debuggers, disassemblers, and C programs** to execute shellcode safely in a lab environment.
